This directory contains a script chempot.py
that computes the excess chemical potential of two ions from two routes.

To use the script, first prepare a template configuration file,
e.g., `my_ions.cfg' under this directory.

In this file, make sure that last covalent bond specified by `dis(..., ...)'
is between the two special ions.
The program will try to change this distance.

Then run the script

  ./chempot.py my_ions.cfg

If you do not specify the configuration file,
the script will grab the first .cfg file under the directory.

In the end, you should see a plot `my_ions.eps',
which compare the PMF from the two routes.

For more options, type

  ./chempot.py -h
