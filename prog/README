Extended Reference Interaction Site Model (XRISM) program: rism0

The main program is `rism0'.
The basic usage is

Here, `your.cfg' is a configuration file for the model,
see `sample.cfg' for an example.
To customize a configuration file,
please use gencfg.html under the web directory.

You can also test a few stock models. For example

  ./rism0 14

tests model 14.
There are 16 models by default.

The default output is out.dat.
The output can be used in Gnuplot.
